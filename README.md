# Sport-Hub-Management
This is continuation of a previous project made 4 years ago : https://github.com/Alison0704/Sports-Membership-Management-Program This one only utilized the console of VisualBasic.Net and therefore can be very limiting for a practical use.

With my recent discovery that Excel uses VBA which consists of VisualBasic.NET language formatting, it would be a great opportunity to expand the project by using Excel while having some hands on practice of common design pattern.
Project scenario: https://pastpapers.papacambridge.com/viewer/caie/as-and-a-level-computer-science-9608-2019-oct-nov-9608-w19-pm-22-pdf. This is the paper I have done during my HSC examination for A - Level Computer Science.
